## EZ Rules

EZ Rules is a lightweight Java framework that allow the users to design the project business logic as rules.

The framework take some ideas of some of the well know Rule frameworks and create a simple and easy to use library.

Some of the features available in the framework are:

 * Powerful Java API
 
 * Rules doesn't depend of Rule super class, any java class can be a rule with the correct annotations

 * Rule grouping with different execution strategy patterns like (stop first run, or execute all)

 * Rules prioritization

 * Generic Context Support, you can pass a set of context to the engine and define the parameters you want in you rules methods. The framework will resolve those parameters for you.
